    <h3>Cherry</h3>
    
    <p>Cherry wood is a type of hardwood that comes from the cherry tree, a species of tree that belongs to the Rosaceae family. There are two main types of cherry trees used for woodworking: the black cherry tree and the wild cherry tree. Both trees produce high-quality lumber, but the black cherry tree is more commonly used due to its larger size and greater availability. (From Custom Country Woods)</p>
    
    <p>Cherry is debatably one of the most beautiful American hardwood species. Its rich reddish color makes it easily recognizable to just about anyone. Cherry is a deciduous hardwood with broad leaves that drop in the fall and have seeds that are contained in ovaries. All deciduous trees are hardwoods. Cherry primarily grows in the eastern half of the USA, with the best stands of cherry being found in the Appalachian region. Cherry trees typically grow to 60-80 feet tall and about 2-3â€™ at DBH (diameter at breast height.) (From Kretz Lumber, Written by Jessica Becker)</p>
